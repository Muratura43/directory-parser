 * POSIX .1 says each process has at least 20 file descriptors.
 * Three of those belong to the standard streams.
 * Here,
 * we use a conservative estimate of 15 available;
 * assuming we use at most two for other uses in this program,
 * we should never run into any problems.
 * Most trees are shallower than that, so it is efficient.
 * Deeper trees are traversed fine, just a bit slower.
 * (Linux allows typically hundreds to thousands of open files,
 *  so you'll probably never see any issues even if you used
 *  a much higher value, say a couple of hundred, but
 *  15 is a safe, reasonable value.)
